CSVG is the work of Cameron McCormack (http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~clm/csvg/index.html).
This source code is a modified version of the orginial source to make it compatbile with
latest Batik Release (1.7). Currently CSVG for Batik 1.7 is in development, so there are some
issues left that have to be considered.
